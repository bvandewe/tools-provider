## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the architecture for extending the **User** and **Agent** entities with multi-dimensional aspects, enabling **stateful, context-aware AI agents** that continuously adapt to users based on:

1. **Semantic Aspect** ("The Map") - Knowledge & Social Graph
2. **Intentional Aspect** ("The Compass") - Goals & Plans with Spec/Status reconciliation
3. **Observational Aspect** ("The Pulse") - Telemetry for empathy & adaptation

### The Vision

> A "Session" is not just a chat window. It is a **Reconciliation Loop** where an AI Agent continuously observes a Human User's Telemetry, references their Graph, and steers them toward their Intent.

### Key Architectural Decision (December 2025)

**Agent is promoted to a first-class Domain Aggregate** with the following characteristics:

- **Per-User Scope**: One agent instance per `(user_id, agent_type)` pair
- **Session as Value Object**: Sessions are owned by agents, not independent aggregates
- **Execution State Persistence**: LLM conversation context is event-sourced for crash recovery
- **Single Agent per Session**: Each session is driven by exactly one agent

See [Agent Aggregate Design](./agent-aggregate-design.md) for the complete mono-dimensional design that must be implemented before adding Polyglot aspects.

### Why This Matters

Standard LLMs fail at personalization because they lack structured context. By feeding the LLM a context vector of `[GraphNode, Spec, Telemetry]`, we:

- Reduce hallucinations through grounded, user-specific context
- Enable proactive support (agent initiates based on observations)
- Maintain alignment between user intent and agent behavior
- Create psychological safety through empathy-aware interactions

## 2. The Three Aspects

### 2.1 Aspect Overview

| Aspect | Metaphor | Purpose | Data Store | Query Pattern |
|--------|----------|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Semantic** | "The Map" | Context & Connection | Neo4j | Graph traversal |
| **Intentional** | "The Compass" | Goals & Plans | Redis | Spec/Status comparison |
| **Observational** | "The Pulse" | Empathy & Adaptation | InfluxDB/Redis | Time-series analysis |

### 2.2 Semantic Aspect: "The Map"

The Semantic Aspect projects the **User** and **Agent** into a Knowledge & Social Graph.

#### Graph Model

```cypher
// User nodes with skills, knowledge, relationships
(:User {id, name, created_at})
(:Skill {id, name, category})
(:Concept {id, name, domain})
(:Resource {id, name, type, url})
(:Agent {id, name, blueprint_id})

// User relationships
(User)-[:MASTERED]->(Skill)
(User)-[:STRUGGLING_WITH]->(Concept)
(User)-[:COMPLETED]->(Resource)
(User)-[:MENTORED_BY]->(User)
(User)-[:PREFERS]->(Agent)

// Agent relationships
(Agent)-[:SPECIALIZES_IN]->(Skill)
(Agent)-[:REQUIRES]->(Tool)
(Agent)-[:ASSIGNED_TO]->(User)
```

#### AI Use Cases

**Reactive Support (Tutor Role):**

```
User Query: "I don't understand 'Decorators' in Python."
AI Action: Query Graph for user's prior knowledge
Insight: (User)-[:MASTERED]->(Functions) but (User)-[:STRUGGLING_WITH]->(Closures)
Response: "Since you know Functions but struggled with Closures, let's review
          Closures first, as they are the building block for Decorators."
```

**Proactive Support (Connector Role):**

```
Trigger: User completes a certification
AI Action: Scan Graph for (UserB)-[:NEEDS_MENTORING_IN]->(Skill)
Response: "Congratulations! I found 3 peers struggling with this topic.
          Would you like to mentor one of them?"
```

#### Domain Model

```python
# domain/aspects/semantic_aspect.py

from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any


@dataclass
class GraphNode:
    """Entity representation in the knowledge graph."""
    entity_id: str
    entity_type: str  # User, Agent, Skill, etc.
    labels: list[str]
    properties: dict[str, Any]


@dataclass
class GraphEdge:
    """Relationship between entities."""
    from_id: str
    to_id: str
    relation_type: str  # MASTERED, STRUGGLING_WITH, etc.
    properties: dict[str, Any]


@dataclass
class SemanticAspect:
    """The Map - User/Agent position in the knowledge graph."""
    node: GraphNode
    inbound_edges: list[GraphEdge]  # Relationships TO this entity
    outbound_edges: list[GraphEdge]  # Relationships FROM this entity

    def get_related(self, relation_type: str) -> list[str]:
        """Get entity IDs related by a specific relation."""
        return [
            edge.to_id for edge in self.outbound_edges
            if edge.relation_type == relation_type
        ]
```

### 2.3 Intentional Aspect: "The Compass"

The Intentional Aspect acts as a **Kubernetes Manifest for Goals**. It defines "Desired State" (Spec) vs "Actual Status" and uses reconciliation to close the gap.

#### Spec/Status Model

```python
# domain/aspects/intentional_aspect.py

from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from datetime import datetime
from enum import Enum


class IntentStatus(str, Enum):
    """Reconciliation state of an intent."""
    ALIGNED = "aligned"       # Status matches Spec
    DRIFTING = "drifting"     # Minor deviation
    DIVERGED = "diverged"     # Significant gap
    STALLED = "stalled"       # No progress detected


@dataclass
class Condition:
    """Status condition (K8s pattern)."""
    type: str                # e.g., "OnTrack", "Blocked", "Completed"
    status: bool
    reason: str
    message: str
    last_transition_time: datetime


@dataclass
class IntentSpec:
    """Desired state declaration for a goal/plan."""
    goal_id: str
    goal_type: str           # CertificationTrack, LearningPath, Project
    target_state: str        # The desired outcome
    target_date: datetime | None
    constraints: dict        # weekly_commitment, learning_style, etc.
    revision: int            # Incremented on spec change


@dataclass
class IntentStatus:
    """Observed actual state toward a goal."""
    current_state: str
    completion_percentage: float
    velocity: float          # Progress rate (e.g., hours/week)
    conditions: list[Condition]
    last_reconciled_at: datetime
    observed_revision: int   # Which spec revision was reconciled


@dataclass
class IntentionalAspect:
    """The Compass - Goals, plans, and reconciliation state."""
    entity_id: str
    entity_type: str         # User, Agent, Session
    intents: list[tuple[IntentSpec, IntentStatus]]
    mode: str                # "learning", "exam", "exploration"

    def is_drifting(self, intent_id: str) -> bool:
        """Check if an intent is drifting from spec."""
        for spec, status in self.intents:
            if spec.goal_id == intent_id:
                return status.velocity < spec.constraints.get("weekly_commitment", 0)
        return False
```

#### AI Use Cases

**Reactive Support (Coach Role):**

```
User Action: Requests to skip a difficult module
AI Action: Check Spec - is this module a hard_requirement?
Insight: Spec says mode="certification", module is critical
Response: "I can't let you skip this. Your goal is 'Senior Architect',
          and this module is critical for the final exam.
          Let's break it down into smaller pieces instead."
```

**Proactive Support (Planner Role):**

```
Trigger: IntentStatus.velocity drops below Spec.weekly_commitment
AI Action: Detect drift (Intent vs Reality)
Response: "I noticed you've only logged 2 hours this week, but your plan
          requires 5 hours to hit your December deadline. I've re-optimized
          your schedule: if you do 30 mins tonight, we get back on track."
```

#### Reconciliation Loop

```python
# application/reconciliation/intent_reconciliator.py

class IntentReconciliator:
    """Kubernetes-style reconciliation for user intents."""

    async def reconcile(self, user_id: str) -> list[ReconciliationAction]:
        """Compare spec vs status and generate actions."""
        intentional = await self._intent_repo.get_aspect(user_id)
        actions = []

        for spec, status in intentional.intents:
            if status.observed_revision < spec.revision:
                # Spec was updated, need to re-plan
                actions.append(ReplanAction(spec, status))

            elif self._is_drifting(spec, status):
                # Status is drifting from spec
                actions.append(NudgeAction(spec, status))

            elif self._is_stalled(status):
                # No progress detected
                actions.append(CheckInAction(spec, status))

        return actions

    def _is_drifting(self, spec: IntentSpec, status: IntentStatus) -> bool:
        target_velocity = spec.constraints.get("weekly_commitment", 0)
        return status.velocity < target_velocity * 0.8  # 20% tolerance

    def _is_stalled(self, status: IntentStatus) -> bool:
        days_since_progress = (datetime.now() - status.last_reconciled_at).days
        return days_since_progress > 7
```

### 2.4 Observational Aspect: "The Pulse"

The Observational Aspect processes **high-frequency, ephemeral telemetry** to enable empathy and real-time adaptation.

#### Telemetry Model

```python
# domain/aspects/observational_aspect.py

from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Any


@dataclass
class TelemetryPoint:
    """Single observation from user behavior."""
    metric_name: str         # TimeOnTask, ClickRageCount, etc.
    value: float
    timestamp: datetime
    tags: dict[str, str]     # session_id, resource_id, etc.


@dataclass
class TelemetryWindow:
    """Aggregated observations over a time window."""
    window_start: datetime
    window_end: datetime
    metrics: dict[str, float]  # Aggregated values
    anomalies: list[str]       # Detected anomalies


@dataclass
class CognitiveState:
    """Inferred cognitive/emotional state from telemetry."""
    engagement_level: float    # 0.0 (disengaged) to 1.0 (focused)
    frustration_level: float   # 0.0 (calm) to 1.0 (frustrated)
    fatigue_level: float       # 0.0 (fresh) to 1.0 (exhausted)
    confusion_level: float     # 0.0 (clear) to 1.0 (lost)
    confidence: float          # Inference confidence


@dataclass
class ObservationalAspect:
    """The Pulse - Real-time empathy and adaptation."""
    entity_id: str
    session_id: str
    current_window: TelemetryWindow
    cognitive_state: CognitiveState
    intervention_history: list[dict]  # Past interventions in this session
```

#### Metrics Collected

| Metric | Description | Inference |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `TimeOnTask` | Duration on current activity | Engagement |
| `IdleTime` | Seconds without input | Stuck/Distracted |
| `SeekRate` | Video rewind frequency | Confusion |
| `TypingSpeed` | Characters per minute | Fatigue |
| `TypingErrorRate` | Errors per minute | Frustration/Fatigue |
| `ClickRageCount` | Rapid repeated clicks | Frustration |
| `SessionDuration` | Total session length | Fatigue risk |

#### AI Use Cases

**Reactive Support (Facilitator Role):**

```
Observation: User pausing video every 10 seconds, rewinding (High SeekRate)
AI Inference: Cognitive overload / Confusion
Response: "This section seems dense. I've paused the video.
          Here is a simple diagram summarizing the last 2 minutes.
          Does this help?"
```

**Proactive Support (Wellness Role):**

```
Observation: SessionDuration > 90 mins AND TypingErrorRate spiking
AI Inference: Fatigue
Response: "You're grinding hard, but your error rate is climbing.
          Science says you've hit the point of diminishing returns.
          I'm locking the session for 15 minutes. Go take a walk!"
```

## 3. The Integrated Session Loop

How the three aspects work together in a single interaction:

### Scenario: User Struggling with a Coding Exercise

```
1. OBSERVATIONAL (The Pulse)
   Input: User has not typed for 45 seconds. Focus window is lost.
   Agent: Wakes up. "User is stuck."

2. SEMANTIC (The Map)
   Input: Agent queries Graph. "What is this exercise testing?"
          → ListComprehensions. "Does the user know prerequisites?" → Yes.
   Agent: "They have the knowledge, so this is likely a syntax error
           or logic block, not a conceptual gap."

3. INTENTIONAL (The Compass)
   Input: Agent checks Spec. "Is user in 'Exploration Mode' or 'Exam Mode'?"
   Spec: mode = "Learning"
   Agent: "I am allowed to give hints. If mode was 'Exam',
           I would only be allowed to encourage."

4. FINAL ACTION
   Agent: "You've been quiet for a minute. Remember, a List Comprehension
           always starts with the expression, not the loop.
           Want to see the syntax template again?"
```

### 4.3 Aspect Projection Handlers

Events from the User aggregate are projected to multiple stores:

## 5. Domain Model: Stateful Agent

> **📋 Phase 1 Implementation**: The mono-dimensional Agent aggregate design is now finalized. See [Agent Aggregate Design](./agent-aggregate-design.md) for the complete specification and [Implementation Plan](../specs/agent-aggregate-implementation-plan.md) for detailed tasks.

### 5.1 Agent Aggregate (Phase 1 - Mono-Dimensional)

The Agent is now a **first-class aggregate** with:

- **Per-User Scope**: One instance per `(user_id, agent_type)` pair
- **Session as Value Object**: Sessions owned by agents, not independent aggregates
- **Execution State Persistence**: LLM context survives crashes
- **Session History**: Learns across sessions for the same user

```python
# domain/entities/agent.py (agent-host) - Phase 1 Implementation

class AgentState(AggregateState[str]):
    """State for the Agent aggregate (mono-dimensional)."""
    # Identity
    id: str                    # "{agent_type}-{user_id}"
    user_id: str
    agent_type: str            # tutor, thought, evaluator, etc.

    # Configuration
    name: str
    preferences: dict[str, Any]

    # Active Session (value object)
    active_session: dict[str, Any] | None

    # Execution State (for suspend/resume - CRITICAL)
    execution_state: dict[str, Any] | None

    # Metrics
    total_sessions: int
    total_interactions: int
    successful_completions: int

    # Session History (last N for context)
    session_history: list[dict[str, Any]]

    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
    last_interaction_at: datetime | None


class Agent(AggregateRoot[AgentState, str]):
    """Mono-dimensional Agent aggregate (Phase 1).

    Key capabilities:
    - Owns Sessions as value objects
    - Persists execution state for crash recovery
    - Tracks interaction history
    - Supports specialized agent types
    """

    def start_session(self, conversation_id: str, session_type: str) -> Session: ...
    def suspend_execution(self, state: ExecutionState, action: ClientAction): ...
    def resume_execution(self, response: ClientResponse) -> ExecutionState: ...
    def complete_session(self, summary: dict | None): ...
    def terminate_session(self, reason: str): ...
```

### 5.2 Agent Aggregate (Phase 2+ - Multi-Dimensional)

The Polyglot extension adds three aspects to the mono-dimensional Agent:
            )
        )

    def assign_to_user(self, user_id: str, role: str):
        """Create assignment relationship in graph."""
        self.state.on(
            self.register_event(
                AgentAssignedToUserDomainEvent(
                    aggregate_id=self.id(),
                    user_id=user_id,
                    role=role,
                )
            )
        )

```

### 5.2 Agent Operational Intents

Agents can have their own "goals" - operational targets for quality:

```python
# Example: Agent Intent Spec
AgentIntentSpec(
    goal_id="response_quality",
    goal_type="operational_target",
    target_state="95% satisfaction",
    constraints={
        "min_response_time_ms": 500,
        "max_hallucination_rate": 0.01,
        "required_citation_rate": 0.9,
    },
)

# Reconciliation: If agent's satisfaction_avg drops below target,
# trigger retraining or escalation
```

## 7. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation (Week 1)

- Add Neo4j and InfluxDB to docker-compose
- Create connection factories and base repositories
- Add settings for new databases

### Phase 2: Semantic Aspect (Week 2)

- Define graph schema (User, Agent, Skill, Concept nodes)
- Create GraphProjectionHandler base class
- Implement UserGraphHandler for skill/relationship events
- Create GraphQueryService for traversals

### Phase 3: Intentional Aspect (Week 3)

- Create IntentSpec/IntentStatus models
- Implement Redis projection for intents
- Create IntentReconciliator
- Add reconciliation background worker

### Phase 4: Observational Aspect (Week 4)

- Create TelemetryCollector service
- Implement CognitiveStateInferrer
- Create session-scoped telemetry aggregation
- Integrate with agent decision loop

### Phase 5: Integration (Week 5)

- Wire aspects into Session controller
- Create unified AspectLoader for agent context
- Update agent prompts to include aspect context
- End-to-end testing

## 8. Key Benefits

### For Users

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: AI manages schedule (Intent) and finds resources (Semantic)
- **Psychological Safety**: Observational aspect ensures supportive, non-judgmental interventions
- **Personalization**: Responses grounded in user's actual knowledge and goals

### For Agents

- **Stateful Learning**: Agents improve through tracked interactions
- **Context Awareness**: Graph provides "zero-shot" understanding of user context
- **Goal Alignment**: Intentional aspect ensures agent serves user's declared objectives

### For the System

- **Clean Separation**: Each aspect has its own projection, query patterns, and lifecycle
- **Scalable**: Time-series and graph databases optimized for their access patterns
- **Event-Driven**: Standard DomainEvents project to all aspects
