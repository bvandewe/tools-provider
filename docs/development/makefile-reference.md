## 🎯 Common Workflows

### First Time Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository (if needed)
git clone <repository-url>
cd starter-app

# Check environment
make env-check

# Complete setup
make setup

# Run the application
make run
```

### Daily Development (Local)

```bash
# Start UI development server (Terminal 1)
make dev-ui

# Start backend with hot-reload (Terminal 2)
make run
```

### Daily Development (Docker)

```bash
# Start all services
make up

# View logs
make logs

# Stop services when done
make down
```

### Testing Workflow

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test layers
make test-domain        # Domain entities
make test-application   # Commands and queries
make test-unit          # Unit tests only

# Run tests with coverage
make test-cov

# View coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html  # macOS
```

### Before Committing

```bash
# Format code
make format

# Run linting
make lint

# Run tests
make test-cov

# Clean up
make clean
```

### Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check status
make status

# Rebuild Docker from scratch
make rebuild

# Clean everything and start fresh
make clean-all
make setup
```

## 🔗 Service URLs

When running locally (`make run`):

- App: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/api/docs

When running with Docker (`make up`):

- App: http://localhost:8020
- API Docs: http://localhost:8020/api/docs
- Keycloak: http://localhost:8021
- MongoDB: mongodb://localhost:8022
- MongoDB Express: http://localhost:8023
- Event Player: http://localhost:8025

Use `make urls` to display all service URLs with configured ports.

## 🎨 Color-Coded Output

The Makefile uses color-coded output for better readability:

- 🔵 **Blue** - Informational messages
- 🟢 **Green** - Success messages
- 🟡 **Yellow** - Warning messages
- 🔴 **Red** - Error messages

## 💡 Tips

1. **Tab Completion**: Most shells support tab completion for make targets
2. **Parallel Execution**: Some targets can be run in parallel (e.g., `dev-ui` and `run`)
3. **Environment Variables**: Commands respect `.env` file settings
4. **Safety First**: Destructive commands (like `docker-clean`) require confirmation
