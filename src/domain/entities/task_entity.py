"""!!!! UNUSED - SAMPLE ONLY !!!!

Task entity for the domain layer.

This is a sample implementation with a simple Entity instead of the full
AggregateRoot with AggregateState and DomainEvents.

The MotorRepository supports both transparently but Application code must
be adjusted to:

- use task.state.* instead of task.* (that is: any task attribute is in its state!)
- use task.state.id() instead of task.id (that is: AggregateRoot's id is a callable)
