    easy:
        value: 0.3
        constraints:
            - 'CIDR /24 or larger (/8, /16, /24)'
            - 'Well-known host counts'
            - 'Example: /24 -> 254 hosts (2^8 - 2)'

    medium:
        value: 0.5
        constraints:
            - 'CIDR /25 through /28'
            - 'Requires calculating 2^n - 2'
            - 'Example: /26 -> 62 hosts (2^6 - 2)'
        weight: 1.5

    hard:
        value: 0.7
        constraints:
            - 'Small subnets /29, /30, /31, /32'
            - 'Edge cases (point-to-point links, single host)'
            - 'Example: /30 -> 2 hosts, /31 -> 2 hosts (special case), /32 -> 0 or 1'
